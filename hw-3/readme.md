["Hello World!" Sketch](https://ecpina.github.io/120-work/hw-3/index.html)

## Week Three Summary
This week we learned what p5 was and it's basic functions. We then created our first page called "Hello World!" where we got to put what we learned to use. This included:

- making comments
- creating a canvas
- adding a colored background
- adding text
- drawing a simple shape

When all was said and done, we then posted it on GitHub and learned how to make the link live and available for everyone to see.

## The Steps
1. Downloaded all neccessary files to complete assigment
2. Created new directory called hw-3
3. Opened the sketch.js
4. Followed along with instructions
  - created a canvas
  - added color to the background
  - added text
5. Saved and pushed to GitHub
6. Make link live

## Issues
For the most part, the assignemnt was pretty straight forward. I didn't have much trouble until the very end when I was trying to get my link to work. At first, it was linking to my readme. I was then able to get it to link to my "Hello World!" page, but it didn't match my code. After a litle bit of tinkering, I somehow got it to work. I'm not exactly sure what I did wrong, but in the end, it worked.

There was one classmate that was having issues with getting her image to appear in her readme. I often struggle with my links, so I offered a solution that I thought might help. She did use a different approach, but she managed to fix the issue.
