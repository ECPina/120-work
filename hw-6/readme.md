[YeeYee! Algorithmic Sketch](https://ecpina.github.io/120-work/hw-6/index.html)

## Week Three Summary
This week proved to be a little more difficult. We were asked to make an algorithmic sketch by using our previous knowledge and the following:
- addition/subtraction
- multiplication/division
- modulo
- exponents
- loops
- The giant list under [Math](https://p5js.org/reference/)
- the map function
- And some more.

## The Steps
1. Put off homework because time is precious and I wasted my time doing frivolous things instead.
2. Struggle A LOT.
3. What is math anyways?
4. Start messing around just to try to get something done.
5. Suddenly something clicks and things start to make a little more sense.
6. Create something nonsensical.

## Issues
Well, I've never been that great at math so this has been quite a journey. It's not terribly hard math, it's just trying to wrap my head around simple math mixed in with coding. I struggle a lot trying to understand a lot of the functions and their purposes and I'm still not very clear on some of them.
