## Week Eight Summary
I honestly didn't know if I would ever figure this part out. I was almost in tears for most of this project. I got it though. After watching video after video and randomly putting things together, I figure it out (hopefully). It's not perfect, but I'm just shocked that I even got this far. God bless Shiffman & the Coding Train.


## Issues
I don't even know where to start. I cycled through several ideas and everything kept breaking over and over again. Finally, I took a break and watched some Danny Gonzalez and I was struck with and idea. I slaved over the keyboard until FINALLY, text began to move across the screen. I honestly was about to give up but I knew I had to just keep trying.
