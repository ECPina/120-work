# ERICA PINA'S SPRING 2019 FINAL PROJECT

## ABOUT
Originally, I wanted to create something that could tell a story. I wasn't sure how exactly I wanted to go about it, but I thought it might be interesting to have clickable items that could bring up different text that would tell a simple story.

Instead, I ended up created a visual image of what looks like creepy crawlers moving over text with the sound of rain and blue random circles in the left upper corner.

## FAILURES
This whole project was really a failure. I wanted to do something a lot more interactive. Everytime I sat down to work on it, I couldn't get my code to work properly. As I was going through it, I realized much of it was because I was putting things out of order or I was missing words or symbols.

At one point I had gotten pretty far, but I couldn't get by buttons to behave properly and my code kept breaking.

I couldn't get my code to load in chrome, but finally I could get it to load in firefox.

At the last minute, I had to start from scratch and try to come up with something, anything. I can't say I'm too proud of this project.

## SUCCESSES
I did managed to figure out how to recreate the rain code and modify it into something a little fun. It was the one thing I was really desperate to try and recreate, but was having no success until the last minute.

## WHAT I LEARNED
I should have asked for help, but my biggest downfall is that I always try to push my way through things until I can fix it on own.

This whole course has been a really big challenge for me. I learn A LOT and I'm hoping that I can still take away everything I learned. I think coding is really invaluable these days and I'd really like to master it. But I think it's going to take me longer than I thought.
